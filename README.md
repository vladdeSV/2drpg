### Introduction
2DRPG differs much from it's predecessor [DRPG](https://github.com/vladdeSV/drpg). Much of the aesthetics is differing from the first game, and also a great part of game mechanics have been replaced.

### Vision
Using [scone](https://github.com/vladdeSV/scone), a variety of colors can be used, opposed to the consoles/terminals default colors. The world is randomly generated by a seed, meaning you will not have to play the same map over and over again. One of the biggest problems with DRPG is that there is merely no variation, which have been improved much with crafting and more creatures.
